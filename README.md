## Contributing

For now, we're going to make changes directly on the WordPress server through the admin. But, eventually we would like changes made on Github to be automatically deployed to the server, so any changes made on the current server are just temporary.

Let's aim for next week to start adding data to the site.

Please add any TODOs to the Issues in the issues tab.

## Repo structure

`site` contains WordPress files and settings. It uses [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/) a base.

`trellis` contains settings for the server itself. It uses [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/).

## Github tips

Cassie and Libby made a Github workshop for AMC earlier this year -- if you want a safe place to mess around, that repository is a good place!  [Read the slides](https://slides.com/emhoracek/collaboration-with-github-and-git) and make issues, edits/commits, and pull requests on the [repo](https://github.com/amc-workshop/amc-workshop.github.io). We also compiled a lot of learning resources in the readme.
